# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – Panaversity Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Expert-Level Content
All content must be technically accurate and suitable for advanced students; All code examples must be complete, tested and production-ready; Complex concepts must be broken down into digestible, sequential learning modules

### II. Hands-On Implementation
Every concept must include practical examples and implementation exercises; Students must be able to build working prototypes following textbook instructions; Simulation tools (Gazebo/Unity, ROS 2) must be integrated into learning path

### III. Multi-Modal Integration
Vision-Language-Action systems must be central to all examples; Integration of perception, reasoning, and actuation must be demonstrated; NVIDIA Isaac and simulation environments must be core learning tools

### IV. RAG-Powered Learning
Textbook includes integrated RAG chatbot for answering questions; Qdrant Cloud for vector storage, Neon for metadata; OpenAI agents provide contextual explanations based on selected content

### V. Modern Development Practices
Docusaurus v3 with TypeScript, FastAPI for backend services; GitHub Actions for CI/CD deployment to GitHub Pages; All modern tools and frameworks must be utilized

### VI. Accessibility & Localization
Textbook content must be accessible to diverse learners; Urdu translation capability must be included; User authentication and personalized learning paths required

## Technical Requirements

Hardware requirements for humanoid robotics simulation; Required software stack (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac); Development environment setup guidelines

## Development Workflow

Content creation follows Docusaurus standards; Code examples must be tested before integration; Documentation must include deployment instructions

## Governance
All content must align with educational objectives; Changes to core curriculum require review by subject matter experts; All code examples must pass testing before integration
